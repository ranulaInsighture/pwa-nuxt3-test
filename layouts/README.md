## Introduction

Layouts in Nuxt 3 serve as templates for your pages. They can include common elements such as headers, footers, navigation menus, or sidebars that should be consistent across multiple pages. This helps you avoid duplicating code and ensures a unified user experience.

This README provides an overview of the layouts available in this folder, their purposes, and how to use them in your project.
