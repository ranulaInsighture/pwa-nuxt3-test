## Introduction

Pages in Nuxt 3 define the different routes and views of your web application. Each page component represents a unique route, and Nuxt automatically generates the routing configuration based on the files in this folder. This folder is a core part of your application's structure.

This README provides an overview of the pages available in this folder, their purposes, and how to use them in your project.

## Available Pages

## Usage

To create new pages or modify existing ones in your Nuxt 3 project, follow these steps:

1. Locate the page file in this folder or create a new one.
2. Define the page component by creating a `.vue` file with the required template, script, and style sections.
3. Configure the routing in your project's configuration (typically in `nuxt.config.js`) if needed.

Example page component structure:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Your page content goes here -->
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
<!-- Your page logic goes here -->
</script>

<style scoped lang="scss">
/* Page-specific styles */
</style>
```
